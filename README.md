MOCK-UP COMPANY - GameWorks Esports
My website is a mock up global company i.e. GameWorks Esports (GWE) that hosts esports tournaments all over the world. The homepage (index.html) introduces what the company does, shows its history, mission and motto. Furthermore, it shows some of the biggest tournaments hosted by GWE i.e VCT Champions Seoul, M4 World Championship etc. which highlights the company's best achievements which would attract more people/companies to ask GWE to host esports tournaments for them. 

DESIGN PROCESS
Originally, I wanted to make a website for aband but after some time, I got mind blocked and was unable proceed on. Thererafter, I thought of using the on going M6 World Championship as an inspiration. That's when I decided to start over and make a website for a game hosting company i.e GameWorks Esports. The design behind the pages was rather simple and more of a informative site which makes it easy for readers to know what the company does and know what the successes some of the largest tournaments hosted by them. Thereafter, I decided to make a page describing and intorducing the on going, M6 World Championship, showing the formats,  teams participating, schedule and where to watch. Moreover, I gave some info on what makes the M - Series go significant and past winners.

FEATURES
When clicking on specific tabs, the site would bring you the respective sites/parts of the website.
When hovering over clickable tabs, the colour changes from white to black

The overall design theme is taken from one of my favourite esports team's site, PaperRex, their site - https://pprx.team/. Then, since from the cover image in M6WorldChampionShip.html, I felt the tint of orangy - gold color would go well with the black background which ultimately led me to decide on the yellowish, orange theme over the black background.
